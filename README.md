# :star2: How to apply for the Technigo Remote frontend program :star2:

We're happy that you're thinking about applying for our boot camp! Here you'll find all information about the code challenge and the written application. The application is designed to let you try out three of the foundations of the program: 

1. Coding
2. Knowledge sharing
3. Self-reflection

The application is however different if you are applying for the full program or only the first part. The first part can be seen as a course in frontend development and is not enough to start working with code directly after. Since the objectives are a bit different, so is the application. 

### Apply for the full program: 

✅First, complete the code challenge. See brief below. 

✅Secondly, write your application. **[Fill in the written application.](https://technigo.typeform.com/to/WYgUEV)**

### Apply only to part 1: 

✅Fill in your written application. 

If you have any questions, plz reach out on hello@technigo.io. 

We will fill seats continuously. You can expect to get an answer from us no later than 14 days from you handing in your application. This means that the faster you hand in your application the faster you'll get an answer and your chans of getting a spot is higher.

Start preparing already now with your employer for potential leave of absence. The program starts on September 3rd – Yay!

Good luck! 

# Technigo Code Challenge

This is the first step, and the most fun, in the application – The Coding Challenge. 

## The brief

Knowledge sharing is a big part of this program. You'll be expected to constantly share your knowledge and help others. Just like developers do in a team. Together we will co-create a glossary of all neccessary words to know for the first part of the education. Your task is to choose **one word** from the glossary.md file in code folder. You should do a little bit of research of the word and create a small webpage that explains the word. Make sure you understand your own explanation. 

Style your page it however you like, go crazy bold or a do it more minimalistic - the important thing is that you have fun doing it! And hopefully learn something new in the process.

## Requirements
Your solution must contain:
* An title.
* A paragraph of text to explain your word (~100 words)
* 3 links to useful resources to read more. 

We don't expect a masterpiece, we expect you to spend about four hours on this assignment. If you haven't coded before we think you might have to add an hour or two to read some of the suggested reading material.

All the application pages will be shared aming those that get accepted into the program and be used as a glossary during the program. Make sure to write in english. 

### Why a coding challenge?
We know that all of you are beginners at programming - we will not judge your solution based on the quality of your code or amount of work. We do however want to see that you’ve touched on a bit of programming before and know what you’re getting yourself into.

Make sure to have fun during the process! Do something that you find interesting and motivating.

## How to complete this assignment

1. Start by sketching with pen and paper how you want your version of Google's login page to look like.
1. Structure your work. Break down your solution in smaller blocks. Estimate how long each block will take to build. Does it sound reasonable to finish? If yes, move on to the next step. If not, go back to step 1 and revise your scope.
1. Download or clone this repository with templates and start coding.

### Download the code files

We have given you a little head start. If you download all files from this project to your computer you will find a `code` folder. The code folder contains of two files, a `index.html` file and a `style.css` file. The most simple approach is to download a code editor and open them in, for example [Atom](https://atom.io/).

In Atom you edit the files. After saving them you can click on the `index.html` file to open it in a web browser to see your webpage take shape. Then you should be all set – happy coding!

### Hand in the assignment

Hand in the assignment by:
* Create an account on Github.com
* Start a new repository or project, make sure it's public.
* [Upload](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) your whole code folder.
* Attach the link to the repository in your [written application.](https://technigo.typeform.com/to/WYgUEV)

Good luck!

### How you will be judged
The coding assignment will be judged by a jury from the industry. All solutions will be anonymously judged, and what we will be looking for is your solution in relation to your previous knowledge – no need to panic!

### :books: Readings

If you haven't coded before we suggest these resources to get you started, but feel free to Google!  

* [What is HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
* [How CSS works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works)

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. Google will very much be you friend in this! Try searching for your questions on Google or for example in an online development community like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) .

### :boom: Success!

After completing this challenge we hope that you will understand more what programming is and if it's for you. You will also gain some knowledge in two of the biggest programming languages, HTML and CSS. But most of all, we hope you had fun!

### :runner: Stretch Goals

If you managed to do everything super quickly and can't get enough of coding, here's some suggestions of what you can add. TOTALLY optional.

1. Use a custom font using [Google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1001467%20%7C%20Material.IO%20%7C%20Global%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Hybrid%20%7C%20Text%20%7C%20BKWS&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItcCyxeaG2AIVwbYYCh3OtgmsEAAYASAAEgJ6O_D_BwE)
2. Make the page responsive and look differently on mobile than desktop.
