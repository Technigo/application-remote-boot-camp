# Apply for the Technigo Remote Web Boot Camp

We're so pleased that you're thinking about applying for our Remote Boot Camp! Here you'll find all information about the code introduction and the written application. The application is designed to let you try out three of the foundations of the program:

1. Coding
2. Knowledge sharing
3. Self-reflection


### What you need to do: 

✅ First, complete the code introduction. See brief below. 

✅ Secondly, **[complete the written application.](https://technigo.typeform.com/to/IkcI5Rbj#applied=xxxxx)**

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at hello@technigo.io.

## 📆 Deadline
The next program starts on January 11, 2022 and your last day to apply is November 17, 2021 (Ocotber 2, 2021 to access early bird pricing). 

We will get back to you no later than 15 working days after you submit your application. We handle applications on a first-come, first-served basis, so we can't guarantee there'll be any spaces left if you wait until the application deadline day – submit your application as soon as you can!

If you get offered a seat on the course, you have seven days to accept your seat. That's when you will officially approve the terms and conditions of the course and sign up. Submitting your application is not binding.

[Check out the course webpage](https://www.technigo.io/program).
for all information about the program, schedule, pricing, payment options and more. 

You will find more information in your "Application Package Email" about the application process and judgement. 

# Technigo Code Introduction

This is the first and most fun step of the application – the Code Introduction. Yes, we want you to try a little coding challenge – don't panic! We simply want to see that you’ve touched on programming before and know what you’re getting yourself into, and it's an opportunity for you to reflect upon your experiences after trying it out. This is just a learning exercise! It will be fun, we promise.

## The Brief
Knowledge sharing is a big part of this program. You'll be expected to constantly share your knowledge and help others, just like developers do in a team. Together, we will co-create a glossary of all the necessary words and terms new web developers should know.

Your task is to explain **one word** from the `glossary.md` file in the attached folder at the top of this page. Choose the word with the number that matches your birthday. You should do a little bit of research on the word and create a small webpage to explain it. Make sure you understand your own explanation!

Style your page however you like - be bold and go gravy, or opt for a more minimalistic approach - the important thing is that you have fun doing it! And hopefully, you'll learn something new in the process.

## Requirements
Your solution must contain:
* A title.
* A paragraph of text to explain the definition your word/term (~100 words)
* Three links to useful resources so we can read more

We're not expecting a masterpiece here! We expect you to spend about four hours on this assignment. If you haven't coded before, you might have to take an hour or two beforehand to read some of the suggested reading material.

All of the application pages will be shared among those that get accepted and be used as a glossary during the program. Make sure you write in English and **do not to add your name or contact details anywhere.** Your coding assignment will be judged anonymously.  

Have fun with the process! Do something that you find interesting and motivating.

## How to complete this assignment

### Download the code files

We have given you a little head start. If you download all files from this project by clicking the green button at the top of this page you will find a `code` folder. The folder contains three files, a `index.html` file, a `style.css` file and the `glossary.md` file. The simplest approach is to download a code editor and open them in that, for example, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

In Visual Studio Code, you can edit the files. After saving them, you can click on the `index.html` in your file browser to open it in a web browser and see your webpage take shape. Then, you should be all set – happy coding!

### Hand in the assignment

Once you're finished just upload your project here on github. Make sure that it's public and contains all code files and images or other media assets that you are using in your project. You'll be asked to link to your project in the written application.

Good luck!

### How you will be judged
The coding assignment will be judged by a jury. All solutions will be judged anonymously, and we'll be looking at how you've applied your previous coding knowledge – there's no need to panic!

**We'll be looking at:** 
* Your usage of HTML tags
* Your usage of CSS such as classes
* That your code is clean and easy to read. 
* If you've met all of the requirements 
* Your approach and solution based on your previous knowledge

### :books: Readings

If you haven't coded, before we suggest these resources to get you started, but feel free to use Google to find other handy resources too!

* [What is HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
* [How CSS works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works)

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer includes learning how to be an expert in problem-solving. Google will very much be your friend through this! Try searching for your questions on Google or, for example, in an online development community like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) .

### :boom: Success!

After completing this challenge, we hope that you develop your understanding of what programming is and if it's for you. You will also gain some knowledge of two of the biggest programming languages, HTML and CSS. But most of all, we hope you had fun!

### :runner: Stretch Goals

If you managed to do everything super quickly and can't get enough of coding, here are some suggestions of what you can add. This is TOTALLY optional.

1. Use a custom font using [Google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1001467%20%7C%20Material.IO%20%7C%20Global%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Hybrid%20%7C%20Text%20%7C%20BKWS&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItcCyxeaG2AIVwbYYCh3OtgmsEAAYASAAEgJ6O_D_BwE)
2. Make the page responsive and look different on mobile devices than it does on desktop
