# Technigo Code Introduction

This is the first step, and the most fun, in the application – The Code Introduction. Yes, we want you to do a little coding challenge – don't panic. Why? Simply to see that you’ve touched on programming before and know what you’re getting yourself into and can reflect upon your experiences after trying it out. This is a learning exercise. It will be fun, we promise. 

## The Brief

Knowledge sharing is a big part of this program. You'll be expected to constantly share your knowledge and help others. Just like developers do in a team. Together we will co-create a glossary of all neccessary words to know for all new web developers. 

Your task is to explain **one word** from the `glossary.md` file in the attached folder on the top of this page. Choose the word with the number that matches your birthday. You should do a little bit of research of the word and create a small webpage that explains the word. Make sure you understand your own explanation. 

Style your page however you like, go crazy bold or a do it more minimalistic - the important thing is that you have fun doing it! And hopefully learn something new in the process.

## Requirements
Your solution must contain:
* A title.
* A paragraph of text to explain your word (~100 words)
* 3 links to useful resources to read more. 

We don't expect a masterpiece, we expect you to spend about four hours on this assignment. If you haven't coded before we think you might have to add an hour or two to read some of the suggested reading material.

All the application pages will be shared among those that get accepted and be used as a glossary during the program. Make sure to write in english and **not to add your name or contact details anywhere in your solution.** Your coding assignment will be judged anonymously.  

Have fun during the process! Do something that you find interesting and motivating.

## How to complete this assignment

### Download the code files

We have given you a little head start. If you download all files from this project by clicking the green button `Clone or Download` at the top of this page you will find a `code` folder. The folder contains of three files, a `index.html` file, a `style.css` file and the `glossary.md` file. The most simple approach is to download a code editor and open them in, for example [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

In Visual Studio Code you edit the files. After saving them you can click on the `index.html` in your file browser to open it in a web browser to see your webpage take shape. Then you should be all set – happy coding!

### Hand in the assignment

Compress your code folder to a zip file. Make sure that all your code files and images or other media assets that you are using are in the folder. Attach the zip file in the written application form. 

Good luck!

### How you will be judged
The coding assignment will be judged by a jury. All solutions will be anonymously judged, and what we will be looking for is your solution in relation to your previous knowledge – no need to panic!

**What we will look at:** 
* Your usage of HTML tags
* Your usage of CSS such as classes
* That you code is clean and easy to read. 
* That all the requiredments are there. 
* Your solution based on the previous knowledge that you have.

### :books: Readings

If you haven't coded before we suggest these resources to get you started, but feel free to Google!  

* [What is HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. Google will very much be you friend in this! Try searching for your questions on Google or for example in an online development community like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) .

### :boom: Success!

After completing this challenge we hope that you will understand more what programming is and if it's for you. You will also gain some knowledge in two of the biggest programming languages, HTML and CSS. But most of all, we hope you had fun!

### :runner: Stretch Goals

If you managed to do everything super quickly and can't get enough of coding, here's some suggestions of what you can add. TOTALLY optional.

1. Use a custom font using [Google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1001467%20%7C%20Material.IO%20%7C%20Global%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Hybrid%20%7C%20Text%20%7C%20BKWS&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItcCyxeaG2AIVwbYYCh3OtgmsEAAYASAAEgJ6O_D_BwE)
2. Make the page responsive and look differently on mobile than desktop.
